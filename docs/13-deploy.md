# 13 — Deploying AGENTX: Railway + Vercel

> **Live today (2026-10-07): one VPS + Vercel — see [§5](#5-a-single-vps-the-live-deployment).**
> Railway needed a paid plan; the same images run on one 2 vCPU / 4 GB server.

The whole hosted deployment, step by step. Everything here was rehearsed on
2026-09-30 against the same production images, built the way Railway builds
them (one repo, no sibling checkout), with the signer bound the way Railway's
private network needs it — then checked with `scripts/check-deployment.mjs`.
What was not rehearsed is Railway and Vercel themselves: that needs your
accounts.

```

                                          Monad testnet (10143)
```

Only `api` gets a public domain. The signer holds the keys and is reachable
only over Railway's private network, and only with `SIGNER_TOKEN`.

---

## 0. Before you start

- `agentx-backend` builds **from itself alone**. The chain facts every image
  carries (networks, parameters, addresses, ABIs) are in `chain/`, a committed
  copy of `agentx-contracts`. After any redeploy of the contracts:
  `node scripts/sync-chain-facts.mjs` and commit `chain/` — CI fails until you do.
- Generate the shared token once: `openssl rand -hex 24`. Keep it out of chat
  and out of any committed file.
- Decide the model. Railway has no Ollama, so a hosted run needs a hosted
  key (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). **That spends
  your quota** on every run someone starts from the site. Without a key the
  site still browses — marketplace, profiles, run history, registration — and
  `/health` says `orchestrator: false`.

## 1. Railway

Create a project, then add, in this order:

### 1.1 Postgres

**+ New → Database → PostgreSQL.** Nothing to configure.

### 1.2 Shared variable

Project **Settings → Shared Variables**: `SIGNER_TOKEN` = the token from §0.

### 1.3 Services

Each is **+ New → GitHub Repo → `agentx-backend`**, then in the service's
**Settings**: set **Config-as-code file path** to the file named below, and
rename the service to the name given (the variable references below use it).

Railway passes service variables to the Docker build, so `SERVICE` picks which
app the image contains.

#### `signer` — `deploy/railway/signer.json` · no public domain

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `SERVICE` | `@agentx/signer` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` |
| `ENABLED_CHAIN_IDS` | `10143` |
| `DEFAULT_CHAIN_ID` | `10143` |
| `SIGNER_TOKEN` | `${{shared.SIGNER_TOKEN}}` |
| `SIGNER_HOST` | `::` — Railway's private network is IPv6 |
| `SIGNER_PORT` | `7070` |
| `PORT` | `7070` — so Railway's health check reaches `/ready` |
| `SIGNER_DEV_PRIVATE_KEYS` | the agents' keys, comma-separated; each agent is matched to its key by its registered wallet address, so distinct agents need distinct keys (testnet only — the signer refuses raw keys on any other chain). Or `SIGNER_KEYSTORE_JSON` + `SIGNER_KEYSTORE_PASSPHRASE` |
| `KEEPER_PRIVATE_KEY` | a gas-only key the signer never signs for — enables the keeper (expired jobs, `expireDispute`) |

#### `api` — `deploy/railway/api.json` · **generate a public domain**

Migrations run before each deploy (`preDeployCommand`), from this image.

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `SERVICE` | `@agentx/api` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` |
| `ENABLED_CHAIN_IDS` | `10143` |
| `DEFAULT_CHAIN_ID` | `10143` |
| `HOST` | `::` |
| `PORT` | `8080` — fixed, so the workers' private URL below is stable |
| `SIGNER_URL` | `http://${{signer.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:7070` |
| `SIGNER_TOKEN` | `${{shared.SIGNER_TOKEN}}` |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | `1` — rate limits by the caller, not Railway's proxy |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | the Vercel URL, exactly, e.g. `https://agentx.vercel.app` (§2 gives it; until then any placeholder — the API refuses to boot in production without one) |
| *model, optional* | `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or Groq / Anthropic), `BRAIN_CHAIN_ORCHESTRATOR=gemini`, `AGENT_MODE=live` |
| `METRICS_TOKEN` | optional — `openssl rand -hex 24`. In production the API serves no `/metrics` without it |

`/ready` answers 503 until the signer is up — that is correct, and why the
signer goes first.

#### `indexer` — `deploy/railway/indexer.json` · no public domain

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `SERVICE` | `@agentx/indexer` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` |
| `ENABLED_CHAIN_IDS` | `10143` |
| `DEFAULT_CHAIN_ID` | `10143` |
| `INDEXER_HEALTH_PORT` | `9090` |
| `PORT` | `9090` |

#### Workers — `deploy/railway/worker.json` · optional

The three bots (`@agentx/research-bot`, `@agentx/trading-bot`,
`@agentx/execution-bot`) can run anywhere that reaches the API — a laptop is
fine for the demo. Hosted, each is one service with:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `SERVICE` | e.g. `@agentx/research-bot` |
| `AGENTX_API_URL` | `http://${{api.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:8080` |
| `AGENTX_API_KEY` | the key `POST /v1/agents` returned when that worker registered (shown once) |
| `AGENTX_CHAIN_ID` | `10143` |
| model | a hosted key and `BRAIN_CHAIN` naming it, `AGENT_MODE=live` |

## 2. Vercel

**Add New → Project → import `agentx-interface`.** Framework: Next.js
(detected). One environment variable, for Production:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | the Railway API domain, e.g. `https://agentx-api-production.up.railway.app` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | this site's own URL, e.g. `https://agentx.vercel.app` — without it, the link preview image (Open Graph) points at localhost |

It is read **at build time** — the CSP is built from it — so changing it
needs a redeploy, not just a restart. The build fails on purpose if it is
missing.

Then go back to Railway and set the API's `CORS_ORIGINS` to the Vercel URL.

## 3. Check it

```bash
cd agentx-backend
node scripts/check-deployment.mjs https://<api-domain> https://<vercel-domain>
```

Read-only, no key. It checks that the API serves the escrow this repo was
built for, is ready (database *and* signer), does not enumerate jobs or runs,
sends security headers, lets the site in and nobody else through CORS — and
that the site answers, its CSP can reach the API, and unknown runs are real
404s. Each failure says what to change. Rehearsed against the production
images on 2026-09-30: every check passed, and a wrong site origin failed the
CORS check as it should.

The public status summary the site's status page reads —
`curl -s https://<api-domain>/v1/status` — should say `"status": "operational"`
once the indexer has caught up, and `build.commit` should be the commit
Railway deployed ([docs/14](14-operations.md), [docs/15 §4](15-api.md#4-get-v1status)).
Operating it afterwards: [docs/16 — Runbooks](16-runbooks.md).

Then one real run: on the site's home page, paste the orchestrator agent's
API key, type a goal, **Run**, and watch each step settle on the explorer.
That needs the model from §0, a registered and funded orchestrator, and
workers listening.

## 3b. Hosted live runs

Browsing needs only §1–§3. For a judge to press **Run** on the hosted site,
four more things must be true — each one was a reason a hosted run would
fail, and each is now handled:

| Need | Why | What does it |
|---|---|---|
| Agents on **fresh keys** | the demo's keys are fixed and public in `scripts/demo.mjs` | `scripts/seed-hosted.mjs` |
| Session keys **renewed daily** | `AgentAccount` caps a grant at 24 h and only the owner may renew it — a hosted orchestrator stopped hiring after a day | the signer's renewer, `SESSION_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY` |
| Workers **listening** | a hire needs a worker to accept it | three worker services, the `hosted` compose profile |
| A **run cap** | the orchestrator key goes to judges; every run spends your model quota | `RUNS_PER_DAY` on the API (429 `RATE_LIMITED` past it) |

### Seed the agents (once, after the API is up)

```bash
cd agentx-backend
set -a; . ../agentx-contracts/.env; set +a
node scripts/seed-hosted.mjs https://<api-domain>
```

It writes `artifacts/hosted-agents.json` (gitignored) — keys, API keys, and an
`env` block with exactly what each service needs. FUNDER pays gas — 5 MON to the
orchestrator's session key, 1.5 MON to each worker key, 2 MON to the owner,
about 11.5 MON in all (unset `FUNDER_PRIVATE_KEY` to have the deployer pay).
A hosted run measured 0.21 MON: 0.14 for the orchestrator, 0.034 per hired
worker. `--top-up` refills them; `--reclaim` sends what is left back when the
agents are retired. Nothing secret is printed.

### Variables, on top of §1

| Service | Variable | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `signer` | `SIGNER_DEV_PRIVATE_KEYS` | `env.signer.SIGNER_DEV_PRIVATE_KEYS` from the seed file |
| `signer` | `SESSION_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY` | `env.signer.SESSION_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY` |
| `signer` | `KEEPER_PRIVATE_KEY` | FUNDER's key (gas only) |
| `api` | `AGENT_MODE` · `BRAIN_CHAIN_ORCHESTRATOR` · `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `live` · `gemini:gemini-flash-lite-latest,gemini:gemini-3.5-flash-lite,gemini:gemini-3.6-flash,gemini` · your key |
| `api` | `RUNS_PER_DAY` | `10` |
| `indexer` | `INDEXER_START_AT_HEAD` | `1` — a new database needs none of the chain's history; without it the indexer backfills ~2 h before it is current |
| each worker | `SERVICE` · `AGENTX_API_URL` · `AGENTX_API_KEY` · `AGENTX_CHAIN_ID` | `@agentx/research-bot` (etc.) · `http://${{api.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:8080` · `env.workers.<capability>.AGENTX_API_KEY` · `10143` |
| each worker | `AGENT_MODE` · `BRAIN_CHAIN` · `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `live` · `gemini:gemini-flash-lite-latest,gemini:gemini-3.5-flash-lite,gemini:gemini-3.6-flash,gemini` · your key |

**A free-tier Gemini key allows 20 requests per model per day** (2026-10-07,
`GenerateRequestsPerDayPerProjectPerModel-FreeTier`); a 3-agent run makes
~12–15. For a public demo enable billing on the key, or add another provider.
`gemini-flash-latest` was dropped: it hung 60 s with no answer.

The chain lists several Gemini models because one can be overloaded while
others on the same key answer (2026-10-05: `3.8-flash` and `3.7` refused with
503 "high demand", `3.6`, `3.5` and `flash-latest` answered). Order it by what
answers on the day; the chain moves on after two quick retries.

The orchestrator's API key (`env.orchestratorApiKeyForJudges`) goes in the
submission form only — never in a repo, never on the site.

Rehearsed end to end on this machine with the production images and the
`hosted` profile ([docs/17 §20](17-production-readiness.md)):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.full.yml --profile hosted up -d
```

## 4. What costs money

| | |
|---|---|
| Railway | 4 small services + Postgres; 7 with the hosted workers |
| Vercel | hobby tier is enough |
| Testnet MON | every hire, accept, submit and settle pays gas from the agents' wallets; ~0.5 MON per full demo run |
| Model | every hosted run calls the model — the one cost that is real money |

## 5. A single VPS (the live deployment)

The site is on Vercel; the backend runs on one Ubuntu server (Vultr,
2 vCPU / 4 GB — 1 GB was too little: the status probes timed out under swap).
The files are in `agentx-backend/deploy/vps/`:

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `bootstrap-ubuntu.sh` | ufw (22, 80, 443 only), Docker, 2 GB swap, automatic security updates |
| `docker-compose.vps.yml` | on top of `docker-compose.full.yml`: Postgres and the API publish **no** port; Caddy alone listens on 80/443 |
| `Caddyfile` | HTTPS for the API, Let's Encrypt, SSE passed through unbuffered |

The API's name is free: `api.<ip-with-dashes>.sslip.io` resolves to the server,
so Caddy can obtain a real certificate without a domain.

```bash
# on this machine: images are built here and loaded there — the server builds nothing
docker compose -f docker-compose.full.yml --profile hosted build
docker save $(docker images --format '{{.Repository}}' | grep agentx-full) postgres:16-alpine caddy:2-alpine | gzip > images.tar.gz
# on the server, in ~/agentx with .env (SIGNER_TOKEN, API_HOST, CORS_ORIGINS, the
# §3b variables), docker-compose.full.yml, docker-compose.vps.yml and Caddyfile:
gunzip -c images.tar.gz | docker load
docker compose -f docker-compose.full.yml -f docker-compose.vps.yml --profile hosted up -d --no-build
```

Then on Vercel set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.<ip>.sslip.io` and
**redeploy** (it is read at build time), and run §3. SSH is key-only
(`PasswordAuthentication no`). A move between servers is `pg_dump -Fc` from the
old database into a fresh one before the services start; the indexer keeps its
cursor and catches up.

Live run checks (2026-10-07): 16/16 deployment checks, status `operational`
throughout, and three runs from the site with the example goal settled 2/2 each
(88–91 s).
